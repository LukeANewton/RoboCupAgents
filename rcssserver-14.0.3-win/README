USING THE SIMULATOR
===================

To run "rcssserver.exe" to start the server

rcssserver will look in the current working folder for the
configuration files:

`server.conf'
`palyer.conf'
`CSVSaver.conf'

If these files do not exist they will be created and populated with
default values.

You can then see what's happening in the simulator by using
monitor. There are a few robocup simulation montior freely
avaiable. The rcsslogplayer windows binary can be used as a monitor
client.
